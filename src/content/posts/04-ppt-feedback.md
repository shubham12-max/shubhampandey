## ðŸ“š What I Learned from Our PESE Presentation Class ðŸŽ¤

In our recent <span className = "custom-highlight">PESE class</span>, every student gave a presentation and our teacher scored us based on our performance. We also got helpful feedback on how we spoke and how our PPTs looked.

I realized that making a good PPT is just as important as the topic itself. A lot of us made small mistakes like:

- Using different fonts on different slides  
- Text overlapping with images or other text  
- Using images that were too bright or had too much going on  
- Putting too much information on one slide  

Our teacher explained that a clean and simple PPT makes a big difference. The slides should be easy to read, have a consistent style, and support what you're saying â€” not distract from it.

This class really helped me understand how to make my future presentations better and more professional. Definitely going to keep these tips in mind!
