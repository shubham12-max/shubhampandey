## **Self Profiling Sheet**

### Q1. Define strengths and weaknesses each in a sentence.
- **Strength:** Strength is the ability to perform well in a particular area, like <span className = "custom-highlight"> problem-solving, communication, or adaptability</span>.  
- **Weakness:** Weakness is something that needs improvement, but with effort, it can turn into a strength.  

### Q2. In your opinion, what is your greatest weakness?
I sometimes overthink things, which slows me down. But I’m working on managing my time better by setting clear priorities.  

### Q3. What do people most often criticize about you?
Some say I take normal work too seriously, but I feel that’s just my way of staying focused.  

### Q4. What is the biggest criticism you have received from:
- **<span className = "custom-highlight2">Parents:</span>** They say I overthink and <span className = "custom-highlight"> should trust myself more</span>.  
- **<span className = "custom-highlight2">Siblings:</span>** They feel I take things too seriously and should relax a bit.  
- **<span className = "custom-highlight2">Relatives:</span>** They say I should be more social and interact more.  
- **<span className = "custom-highlight2">Friends:</span>** They joke that I focus too much on work and don’t have enough fun.  
- **<span className = "custom-highlight2">Teachers:</span>** They have told me to speak up more and share my thoughts confidently.  

### Q5. What do you find is the most difficult decision and why?
I find it difficult choosing between different priorities, especially when everything seems important. I try to handle it by thinking about what will have the best long-term outcome.  

### Q6. How do you handle failure?
<span className = "custom-highlight"> Failure does create some stress</span>, but I try to handle it and move forward. I analyze what went wrong, learn from it, and improve myself for the next time.  

### Q7. How do you handle success?
I take a moment to appreciate it, usually by celebrating with family and friends. But after that, I focus on what’s next and how I can keep improving.  

### Q8. How do you view yourself - calm, aggressive, patient, impatient, dominant, confident, submissive, social, reserved—and why?
I am generally <span className = "custom-highlight">calm and patient</span> because I think before reacting. But I do get impatient when things slow down unnecessarily or don’t go as expected.  

### Q9. Who do you compare yourself to and why?
I compare myself to <span className = "custom-highlight">my father because he is disciplined and hardworking</span>. I admire his dedication and patience and try to learn from him.  

### Q10. What major challenges have you faced so far and how did you handle them?
When I went to JNV, a hostel-based school, in 6th standard, it was a big challenge to stay away from my parents at such a young age. But over time, I got used to it and learned to manage living away from home.  

### Q11. What was the biggest compliment you have received so far?
Someone once told me <span className = "custom-highlight">I am a quick learner and grasp things easily</span>.
