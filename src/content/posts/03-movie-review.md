This line, written by Andy Dufresne in a letter to Red, serves as the emotional core of the film. It underscores the power of hope in overcoming adversity.

This quote resonates deeply because it highlights the resilience of the human spirit and the idea that hope can drive us forward even in the most challenging circumstances.
